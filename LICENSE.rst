This project is comprised of a configuration file for InnoSetup_, a binary
file template create from BgInfo_, and a light touch of documentation.

I am not a lawyer, but I doubt that I could license the ``bginfosetup.iss``
file even if I chose to.  While ``bginfosetup.iss`` is "just a config file" it
is much like source code.  As with source code, it contains intructions on how
to create a program.  It even has a few lines of Pascal_, a "true" programming
language.

That beign said, there is nothing new or truly different being done.  Since I
started from the InnoSetup wizard, I expect ``bgsetupinfo.iss`` to be very
similar to many other ``iss`` files.

While the documentation is of my creation, the only value I see in it is that
of instructing others. Hopefully it does that job somewhere above "OK".

So, I don't know if I *need* this file in here.  The fact that I'm unsure is a
slightly frightening reflection on the current copyright system.  Anyway, have
fun, I hope this helps.
